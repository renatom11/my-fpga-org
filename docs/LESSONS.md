# LESSONS — the tier-1 core

This file is the **tier-1 core** of the three-tier lessons taxonomy
(PROTOCOL §7.1; the sponsor's numbering runs by descending generality —
"tier 1 general, tier 2 domain, tier 3 project specific"):

- **Tier 1 — general**, this file: rules that improve the agent doctrines
  universally. Bar **LH2-g** — the rule statement contains no proper noun
  of any project or domain.
- **Tier 2 — domain**: rules portable across projects sharing a technical
  domain, kept as packs in [`docs/domains/`](domains/) and loaded by a
  project only when relevant.
- **Tier 3 — project**: rules needing project vocabulary; they live in the
  project's own local accretion and never leave it.

Entries arrive here through the per-gate lessons harvest (PROTOCOL §7.1)
and through reviewed contributions from other organizations
([`docs/FEDERATION.md`](FEDERATION.md)): staged on a branch, screened by
the reviewer agent, merged by a human maintainer — never automatically —
with core `L-` ids allocated at the landing fence
([FEDERATION](FEDERATION.md) §4).

**Nothing here is directly normative — entries reach work through two
channels** (ADR-0012). Routine: a work order's **Standing lessons in
force** section, filled by the issuing lead from this core and the
BOARD-declared packs, binds the entries it cites for that task.
Structural: an entry whose normative home names a protocol section,
charter, playbook, or template carries an **amendment obligation**
(FEDERATION §5.1/§8.1 step 4b) — it graduates into the documents agents
already must read, or is re-marked "narrative only". Each entry names its
normative home (PROTOCOL §, ADR-000N of this shell, or a playbook) or
says "narrative only". The entries below are the seeding harvest — the operating record
this shell was distilled from. Citations are permalinks into the public
[agentic-fpga program](https://github.com/renatom11/agentic-fpga), pinned at
commit `1799e10a37f19059ac3337982af4b6d035e14d0c` (the seeding pin; one
source document landed past the pin and is cited at its landing commit,
noted where it occurs). Journal entry IDs (`J-<agent>-NNNN`) locate entries
inside the linked journals.

Playbook references point at the operating playbooks in
`docs/playbooks/` — `mutation-campaign.md`, `review.md`,
`packet-splitting.md`, `ci-evidence.md`, and the harvest procedure itself,
`lessons-harvest.md`. (Per-entry "(planned)" markers inside Now-lives-in
lines are part of the merged seeding record and stand as written.)

**Optional entry fields** (ADR-0010): `**Supersedes.**` on an entry that
resolves a contradiction, naming the id it replaces, and
`**Superseded-by.**` on the losing entry — which is never deleted;
`**Recurrence.**` — appended by the landing fence when the redundancy
screen drops an independently re-derived duplicate (count plus citing
packet ids; at the third independent arrival the entry opens a promotion
obligation on the board — [`docs/FEDERATION.md`](FEDERATION.md) §8).

**Growth law** (ADR-0010, documented convention): this file and the packs
accrete without bound by design, and roll over like journals when they
approach the blob gate — a volume chain (`LESSONS.v2.md`, with a back-link
in the new volume's header) is the remedy, adopted as convention with an
advisory threshold at 800000 bytes; the commit script's blob gate is the
hard ceiling. Machine enforcement of the chain (an R10 analogue) is
deliberately deferred until growth makes it worth a script change.

## A. Commit & journal discipline

### L-A01 — Stage a shared packet on notification, after hunk-level review
**Rule.** A shared packet is staged only after the responsible agent's
completion notification — never on the packet's RETURNED stamp — and only
after a hunk-by-hunk diff against HEAD confirms every hunk belongs to the
committing agent; known-concurrent actors on one packet are serialized.
**Incident.** Commit `6181781` swept dv's in-flight countersignature block
into a data_wrangler-attributed commit; R4 passed because content-level
authorship isn't machine-checked, and a `tail -2` glance had stood in for
review. A separate staging race nearly committed a packet before a late
Return-log fragment landed.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/packet-splitting.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0125`, `J-orchestrator-0052`.

### L-A02 — One lead at a time per journal
**Rule.** Only one spawn of a given lead is active at a time ("one dv
sitting at a time keeps its journal serial and its independence clean"),
and parallel lanes run only on disjoint paths with disjoint journals.
**Incident.** Adopted as standing orchestration practice early and
reaffirmed late; the serial journal is what makes R3/R5 attribution and the
one-entry-per-commit invariant workable.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/packet-splitting.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0084`, reaffirmed
`J-orchestrator-0127`.

### L-A03 — The split-commit procedure for two agents' uncommitted layers
**Rule.** A packet carrying two agents' uncommitted layers is committed by
reconstructing the earlier worker-era intermediate, verifying the later
layer is a pure insertion against HEAD, and committing each layer under its
own identity.
**Incident.** First worked out during the first bench round's
bounce-and-fix arc and reused for three later packets; it is the honest
alternative to attributing one agent's words to another.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/packet-splitting.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0104`, `J-orchestrator-0127`;
[WO-0038] (the arc).

### L-A04 — Corrections append; they never rewrite
**Rule.** A paperwork inconsistency is corrected by an appended, attributed
correction ("marked, not rewritten") — and a correction request that is
itself wrong may be refused by the record's author, with reasons, on the
record.
**Incident.** A header/state double-match and an audit tally error were
both left in place and marked. Separately, the orchestrator asked dv to
"correct" an entry after misreading a journal mid-append — the flag was
false, and dv refused it and said why; the refusal is part of the record.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0002 (decision 6); PROTOCOL §4 (append-only).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0085`, `J-orchestrator-0063` →
`-0064`; [ADR-0002-src] (correction footer); [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0042`.

### L-A05 — Anchor a state flip on title + state, never on a bare state line
**Rule.** A scripted packet header/state flip matches on title plus state,
because a bare `- **State**: ISSUED` line also matches Return-log quotations
of it.
**Incident.** The flip script's FAIL 2: an ISSUED header sat under an
ACCEPTED block because the pattern matched the wrong occurrence.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/packet-splitting.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0085`.

### L-A06 — Journal-only commits are a first-class class
**Rule.** An incident goes on the record immediately as a journal-only
commit (`- (none)` files list, `Journal-Only: true` trailer) while lanes
keep working — the record does not wait for the next work commit.
**Incident.** First used to put a spawn kill on the record mid-flight;
ubiquitous thereafter.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §5 (R2).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0063` onward.

### L-A07 — Commit order is the ordering evidence; header timestamps are not
**Rule.** Journal header timestamps are not evidence of ordering; commit
order is, and ordering claims are audited from SHAs.
**Incident.** dv's journal header dates drifted weeks ahead of the real
date while committing normally; nothing in the enforcement machinery reads
the header date, and an auditor who did would have been misled.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §9 (Ordering).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0062`.

### L-A08 — Incremental writes for large spawns
**Rule.** A spawn producing large artifacts writes incrementally — small
writes plus edits, one module fully on disk before the next — so an
output-token cap kills at a module boundary, not mid-file.
**Incident.** The first RTL-lead spawn was killed by the 64,000-output-token
cap with work stranded in the transcript; the respawn instruction carried
the incremental-write discipline and it held thereafter.
**Now lives in.** Narrative only.
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0063`; [J-rtl] `J-rtl_lead-0002`.

### L-A09 — The blob gate
**Rule.** No staged file exceeds the blob threshold; large data ships as a
fetch script plus checksum manifest, never as a committed blob.
**Incident.** The pre-G0 review flagged the honesty gap (a charter claimed a
size limit no script checked — COH-8); the gate was implemented with its
proving scenarios rather than left as a claim.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §5 (blob gate).
**Provenance.** [ADR-0002-src] (§6, deferred debt); implemented at [J-orch]
`J-orchestrator-0015`; [agent-commit].

### L-A10 — The bounded, recorded, end-conditioned override
**Rule.** A gate that fires on legitimate growth gets a bounded,
journal-recorded override with a written end condition — never a policy
change by silent threshold bump — and each use is counted.
**Incident.** dv's journal hit 1,013,298 bytes and the blob gate blocked
every future dv commit; the response was `AGENT_COMMIT_BLOB_MAX=1100000`
scoped to dv's commits, uses counted in the journal, end condition pinned
to the rotation fix, and an ADR routed to the architect.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §5 (blob gate paragraph); ADR-0002 (decision 5);
ADR-0005.
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0137` (recorded at the seeding pin
itself); [ADR-0017-src] §1, §7 (landed past the seeding pin; cited at its
landing commit).

### L-A11 — Enforcement changes ship with their proving scenario
**Rule.** Any change to enforcement semantics lands with a
`test_protocol.sh` case proving the new behavior, and rejection tests
assert the refusal reason.
**Incident.** The first audit found semantics changed with no test (F2) and
three self-test scenarios passing for a rule other than the one they named
(F1); the suite has grown with every enforcement change since.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §5 and §11(3); ADR-0002 (decision 4).
**Provenance.** [AUD-0001] via [ADR-0003-src] (F1, F2); [J-orch]
`J-orchestrator-0015`; [test-protocol].

## B. Review discipline

### L-B01 — Every claim carries a provenance class
**Rule.** Any quantity or mechanism claim in a verdict, freeze, or packet is
**measured** (the command shown), **derived** (the derivation shown), or
**relayed** (the source named) — a relay is not a measurement, and a code
comment is a relay, not a derivation.
**Incident.** "Fifteen units" originated in an orchestrator relay nobody had
counted, was re-signed by dv, then ordered as an "eighteen unit" freeze;
the real count was 12. Later, dv routed a worker around a trap in a way
that could not work because it reasoned from a comment instead of following
one call — "three-for-three against me".
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10 (evidence rules).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0042` (verbatim block), `J-dv_lead-0058`,
`-0059`; [WO-0047] §6.9; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0115`.

### L-B02 — A rule is weaker than a tool; fix the file, not the journal
**Rule.** Where a rule's failure is structural (nothing prints the number),
build the instrument — and put the correction where the mistake is, not
where the reasoning lives, because a fix recorded only in a journal does
not protect the file it was made in.
**Incident.** dv reintroduced a counting bug in the very file where it had
fixed that bug one work order earlier; the journal knew, the file did not.
Named as the fourth instance of the same lesson.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0002 (decision 3); docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0042`.

### L-B03 — Verify against the tree, not the Return log's account of it
**Rule.** A reviewer verifies confinement and content against the diffs and
the tree, never against the Return log's description of them ("untouched
files confirmed per git, not per claim").
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0016`, `J-dv_lead-0024`.

### L-B04 — Prove a check against its target before relying on it
**Rule.** A guard is run against the defect it names before it ships, and a
stimulus is verified at both failure sites — its own construction, and
whether the bench actually drove it.
**Incident.** A guard dv prescribed to catch a reversed-schedule defect
turned out not to catch it, established by running dv's own text against
the original bug. Separately, a driven-word check caught an unwired hook
that the stimulus-side check could not — a gap in dv's own packet, closed
by the worker's instinct.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0028`, `J-dv_lead-0050`; [WO-0047] §6.7.

### L-B05 — A verbatim fix instruction owns the prose it falsifies
**Rule.** A verbatim fix instruction carries the obligation to repair any
prose the fix falsifies, as a standing rule, so scope is not re-litigated
per round.
**Incident.** A round-3 docstring deviation was ruled in scope on exactly
this ground.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0026`.

### L-B06 — Trace a change against the code it will run beside
**Rule.** A prescribed change is traced against the code it will actually
run beside before it is prescribed.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [WO-0047] §6.8; [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0023` era.

### L-B07 — A repair that moves an observation point moves nothing else
**Rule.** When a repair moves an observation position, check that no
constant moved alongside it — otherwise a repair and a fit are
indistinguishable.
**Incident.** The round-6 sampling-edge shift was accepted only after
verifying every expected constant stayed put.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0033`.

### L-B08 — Promotions pass conformance review, and poison never promotes
**Rule.** No promotion enters the tree without the verification lead's
conformance review — a round that fills an existing expectation block is
routing around that rule — and a promotion payload carrying a crash or
uncaught error is held out of the tree, never adopted as an expectation.
**Incident.** During a bench/design disagreement round, promoted sources
carried uncaught-exception text; the standing rule kept them from ever
becoming expectations.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned); ADR-0003 (decision 2).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0033`; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0106`.

### L-B09 — A committed model-vs-hand tripwire has three duties
**Rule.** A tripwire comparing a model against hand-computed values may live
in a committed test only if it raises (not prints), names its finding
class, and routes to the verification lead with an explicit bar on adopting
either side.
**Incident.** The third use of the idiom, in family E, was accepted on
exactly those three conditions; anything less converts a disagreement
detector into a silent tie-breaker.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0050`.

### L-B10 — The bench-surface budget bounds exports, not helpers
**Rule.** The bench's exported surface is budgeted; a row's own helpers are
not — and a worker who believes an export is needed returns the question
rather than adding it.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0050` (precedent); [WO-0047] §4.3.

### L-B11 — A convention retrofit is a change, stated and re-run
**Rule.** Where two valid conventions coexist, a retrofit to the newer one
is paired with a re-run and stated as a change — never folded quietly into
another packet's diff.
**Incident.** Two strobe-window conventions coexisted across three
mutation-qualified files; the ruling forbade a quiet harmonization inside
an unrelated diff.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0058` (ruling 2).

### L-B12 — Read the governing requirement before designing the artifact
**Rule.** The governing requirement is read before a verification artifact
is designed against it ("a rule I keep needing and keep relearning").
**Incident.** A comparison-domain draft reinvented four clauses of the
governing requirement and broke a fifth.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0052`.

### L-B13 — Precedent searches are scoped, and taint is recorded, not waved
**Rule.** A precedent search scopes to the tree it is about, and an exposure
it reveals is recorded as a taint against the affected module — binding on
future work — rather than waved off.
**Incident.** A precedent grep printed two lines of another module's
internals; no taint attached to the module under review, and a recorded
taint attached to the other, binding on any future sign-off for it.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0024`; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0104`.

### L-B14 — Commit the bounce as-is
**Rule.** A bounced return is committed as-is, so the bounce-and-fix arc
lives in the diff rather than being tidied out of history.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0100`; [WO-0038] (RV-0038 BOUNCE).

### L-B15 — A proposed rule is backtested over the corpus before adoption
**Rule.** A rule proposed for adoption is run backwards over the historical
corpus first, and the corpus verdict (what it flags, what it misses) goes
in the adopting ADR.
**Incident.** dv's seal rule as first worded flagged nine commits in
history and was wrong about eight — including the verdict that discovered
the defect the rule exists to prevent. One word changed; all eight cleared;
the incident stayed caught.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §11; ADR-0004 (decision 4).
**Provenance.** [J-arch] `J-architect_docs_lead-0018`; [ADR-0016-src] §2.1.

## C. Campaign & blinding discipline

### L-C01 — Freeze first, in a separate sealed companion, with three-way predictions
**Rule.** The campaign freeze — brief plus SEALED predictions companion
classifying every scoring cell REQUIRED / MUST-STAY-GREEN / PERMITTED — is
committed before any defect exists, and the seeder is spawned only
afterwards.
**Incident.** Predictions live in a separate sealed file, not a sealed
annex, because "a bar you can trip over by opening a file is not a bar". A
flat kill list scores every monitor surprise as a prediction failure and
gets quietly widened after the fact; committed MUST-STAY-GREEN is what
makes the test two-sided.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10 (mutation discipline); ADR-0006
(decisions 1–2).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0035`; [WO-0039] §0/§4/§5/§6.

### L-C02 — Mutant branch hygiene
**Rule.** Each mutant is known-green parent SHA plus exactly one diff, on a
throwaway never-merged branch carrying a greppable marker, and the frozen
base SHA is re-confirmed green at the campaign's first and last runs.
**Incident.** Remote branch deletion was refused by the push proxy, so the
markers plus an auditor marker-check duty became the cleanup guarantee —
the drift insurance held across all five campaigns.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0006 (decision 4).
**Provenance.** [WO-0039] §4; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0113`.

### L-C03 — Kills count in named rows with named messages, because messages discriminate
**Rule.** A kill counts only in the named rows with the named message — a
right row with the wrong message is a finding, not a pass — because row
sets do not discriminate between defects; messages do.
**Incident.** Three family-D mutants shared one row set and were separated
only by which assertion spoke; sealing messages is what bought the
discrimination, confirmed a third time in family E.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0006 (decisions 5–6).
**Provenance.** [WO-0039] §6; [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0044`, `J-dv_lead-0054` §3.

### L-C04 — Results are relayed verbatim, and a green run is relayed prominently
**Rule.** Campaign results are relayed as verbatim test-runner output
including the name of every failing unit ("a paraphrase destroys it"), and
a green run is relayed prominently because a survived mutation is the
campaign's most important possible result.
**Incident.** The rationale of record: "a green run here is
indistinguishable from a suite that never executed a single check."
**Now lives in.** ADR-0006 (decision 5); PROTOCOL §3 (relay classes).
**Provenance.** [WO-0039] §5.4, §7; [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0034`.

### L-C05 — A sealed prediction is never edited — after its result or before it
**Rule.** A freeze is never edited after its result (a falsified sealed
prediction stays as written and dies on the record), and a seal reasoning
from what a row asserts beats a correction reasoning from a second-hand
mechanism — verify the detail first or leave the prediction alone.
**Incident.** A pre-result ruling replaced a right prediction with a wrong
one ("more analysis made the answer worse"), compounded by iteration-order
blindness inside the very ruling that named assertion-order blindness. The
falsified text stayed in the freeze, as had a falsified prediction one
campaign earlier — "the fourth time that rule has bound me".
**Now lives in.** ADR-0006 (decision 7).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0044`, `J-dv_lead-0054`; [J-orch]
`J-orchestrator-0121`.

### L-C06 — An equivalent-mutant claim is a proof obligation
**Rule.** Equivalence is proven over the whole legal stimulus space — down
to the spec's floors, not the bench's habits — never conceded from the
suite's failure to kill.
**Incident.** D-M3 survived; dv computed the margin over every terminate
lane, start lane, length, and gap down to the spec's floor of 9 rather
than the benched 12, and recorded "EQUIVALENT MUTANT. Proven, not
conceded."
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0006 (decision 9).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0044` §3; [WO-0041].

### L-C07 — Every qualification owes a silently-always-pass mutation
**Rule.** Each qualification seeds at least one mutation that makes the
design silently agree with every existing assertion — the class whose
symptom is a green suite that checks nothing.
**Incident.** A requirement's positive direction was unverified: a design
hardwiring the verdict *good* passed all fifteen tests. The class became
"the standing rule now owed to every qualification".
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0006 (decision 8).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0037`; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0113`.

### L-C08 — The denominator never moves mid-campaign
**Rule.** No row, unit, or bench edit lands between a freeze and its
scoring; the denominator is measured at freeze and stays fixed.
**Incident.** The "eighteen units" that did not exist, and a later
"nineteen" corrected by the tool built to stop exactly that; honoured in
practice when a new row was scored first and added second.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0006 (decision 3).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0053`, `J-dv_lead-0054`,
`J-dv_lead-0061`.

### L-C09 — Assertion order and iteration order are part of the contract
**Rule.** Before sealing a message, read every unit's assertion order and
iteration order — fail-fast loops mean only the first case speaks — and
order assertions deliberately (structural first, specific after),
announcing any reorder prominently.
**Incident.** A sealed message was unreachable: the unit asserted word
count before delivered octets and iterated ascending, so the sealed text
could never be the one that spoke.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0006 (decision 6); docs/playbooks/mutation-campaign.md
(planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0053`; [WO-0047] §4.2.

### L-C10 — The reviewer's artifacts are sealed surface for the next campaign
**Rule.** A review verdict that describes bench internals, the lead's
scratch files, and campaign-adjacent commit subjects are all part of the
next campaign's sealed surface — checked when the campaign is designed,
not after — and campaign-adjacent subjects are kept deliberately thin.
**Incident.** A verdict described a bench file's internals line by line; a
commit subject named the prediction matrix's dimensions; a later subject
carried the campaign score and was caught only by the auditor's voluntary
refusal to run an unscoped `git log`. dv: "my rules keep arriving one
commit late."
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10 (information hygiene); ADR-0007
(decisions 6–7).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0040`, `J-dv_lead-0043`,
`J-dv_lead-0045`/`-0046`; [WO-0050] §1 (bar 11).

### L-C11 — Publish intents; seal the mapping
**Rule.** Mutation intents (defect classes) are published to the party that
must build against them; the row mapping, the must-stay-green set, and the
exact messages stay sealed.
**Incident.** One brief published the mutation→row kill table to the bench
author, structurally weakening the next campaign before it ran; the
corrected protocol ("intents-public / mapping-sealed") held across the two
campaigns that followed.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0007 (decision 2).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0040` (proposal); [WO-0040] §9 (the
leak); [WO-0045] §0 (first run); [WO-0050] §0 ("has now held across two
campaigns").

### L-C12 — An intent is never a licence to break a second rule
**Rule.** When a spec rule collides with a mutation intent, the seeder
preserves the spec rule and discloses the collision.
**Incident.** Two auditor resolutions of ambiguous intents, both
spec-faithful and disclosed; the clause "earned its place three times" and
became standing text in the last two briefs.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0006 (decision 11).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0043`; [WO-0045] §2; [WO-0050] §2.

### L-C13 — A kills cell names a defect, or the row was not thought about
**Rule.** Every attack-plan row states what defect kills it; "a row whose
kill is 'a broken design' is a row that was not thought about".
**Now lives in.** ADR-0001 (decision 6);
docs/playbooks/mutation-campaign.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0013`; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0066`.

### L-C14 — Snapshot drift is not a unit
**Rule.** Snapshot/determinism drift is never scored as an unnamed-unit
finding and never harvested as an expectation.
**Incident.** A mutant survived the suite and failed only at determinism on
its own snapshot drift; scoring that as a kill would credit the bench with
teeth it does not have.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0006 (decision 10).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0046`; [WO-0042] (the mini-round it
bound).

### L-C15 — A bar list is a floor
**Rule.** The seeder discloses ambient exposure beyond the enumerated bars,
and the call on whether an exposure voids a mutation is the campaign
lead's, not the seeder's.
**Incident.** A shared scratchpad listing showed other agents' copies of
barred artifacts, and one path-scoped history command touched a barred
path; the auditor disclosed both unprompted and dv made the void calls.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0007 (decision 4).
**Provenance.** [J-aud] `J-auditor-0004`, `J-auditor-0005`.

### L-C16 — The seeder is a no-stake third party
**Rule.** The verification lead never self-seeds; seeding goes to a
third party with no stake in the verdict, authoring diffs in its own tree,
with the orchestrator applying, CI executing, and the lead adjudicating.
**Incident.** dv escalated its own conflict: self-seeded taint would be
unrecoverable for the families not yet written. The ruling chose the
auditor as seeder, and the four-party split held for all five campaigns.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0007 (decision 5).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0035`; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0111`.

### L-C17 — The readable set is an allowlist
**Rule.** The seeder's readable paths are an allowlist stated in the brief;
everything else is out of bounds by construction, and anything needed
beyond it is asked for through the orchestrator rather than read.
**Incident.** The deny list had grown to ten items and "it failed once
already", when dv's own adjudication put a round's predicted kill into a
brief the seeder read. The inversion's rationale of record: "An allowlist
cannot be defeated by a document I forgot to enumerate."
**Now lives in.** ADR-0007 (decision 3); PROTOCOL §10.
**Provenance.** [WO-0045] §1; [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0051`; [WO-0050] §1
(standing, plus root build configuration).

### L-C18 — Blinding's costs are recorded, not hidden
**Rule.** A regime change records what it costs: tightening a bar can
remove the evidence that would discharge a disclosure made under it, and a
rule whose safe application depends on per-invocation expertise will
eventually be applied wrong — so such rules are made total instead of
clever.
**Incident.** Both sentences are the source's own, recorded when the
history bar became total rather than flag-scoped and when a tightened bar
stranded a disclosure.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0007 (decision 8, Consequences).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0046`, `J-dv_lead-0043`.

## D. CI & evidence discipline

### L-D01 — CI is the authoritative build environment, and its diff is the only promotion source
**Rule.** No gate signature or sign-off rests on a local build result;
evidence cites a CI run ID and conclusion, and machine-produced
expectations are promoted from CI's own diff output, never authored by
hand.
**Incident.** The source's container could not install its toolchain, so
the constraint was ruled into a regime: "writing a plausible-looking
waveform into an expect block would be fabricated evidence — the one thing
the journal protocol exists to prevent."
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10 (evidence rules); ADR-0003 (decisions 1–2).
**Provenance.** [ADR-0005-src] (Decision, rules 1–2).

### L-D02 — The promotion-block pattern
**Rule.** When a run's diff is the promotion source, CI emits a checksum
plus a compact re-creatable encoding of every staged path **after** the
diff (so it sits at the log tail inside any bounded fetch window), and
evidence-producing steps run before any checker that could suppress them.
**Incident.** A log fetch capped at 5,000 lines against an ~11k-line diff
while the raw-log URL was blocked by egress policy — the promotion source
was unretrievable; separately, a checker failure before the promotion step
suppressed the diff that *is* the promotion source.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0003 (decision 3); docs/playbooks/ci-evidence.md
(planned).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0067`, `-0068`, `-0079`, `-0080`.

### L-D03 — Post-processing output to satisfy a checker is fabricating conformance
**Rule.** Generated output is never post-processed to satisfy a checker;
the honest repairs are a checker fix and a workflow fix.
**Incident.** A checker false-FAIL invited a "fix" that would have rewritten
the emitted artifact to pass; the implementation lead refused and named it,
and the orchestrator accepted the checker/workflow repairs instead.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0003 (Alternatives); docs/playbooks/ci-evidence.md
(planned).
**Provenance.** [J-rtl] `J-rtl_lead-0004`; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0067`.

### L-D04 — NO-VERDICT is a class of its own
**Rule.** A skipped, absent, or failed-to-install verification lane is
never a PASS, and a broken harness is never reportable as an anchor
finding — exit classes partition along *did the lane reach a verdict?*,
run summaries distinguish *ran and agreed* from *did not run*, and no
sign-off cites a run in which the lane did not execute.
**Incident.** The differential lane's run 1 exited DIFFERENTIAL for a
canonical-format rejection when no comparison had occurred; the repair
added a distinct NO-VERDICT exit class, also fixing an exit-code collision
with the language runtime's own failure code.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0003 (decision 4).
**Provenance.** [ADR-0015-src] D1 ("the rule that matters most"); [J-dv]
`J-dv_lead-0059`; [WO-0049] §8; [J-dw] `J-data_wrangler-0003`;
[run_cosim].

### L-D05 — Producers conform to the grammar
**Rule.** A comparator's fail-closed reader is never relaxed to accommodate
a producer: producers conform to the grammar; the grammar does not
accommodate producers.
**Incident.** Had the reader normalised a malformed field, the anchor lane
would have issued its first agreement on machinery that was not working.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0003 (decision 5).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0059`.

### L-D06 — Standing requirements on any new CI lane
**Rule.** A new lane lands as a separate job, installs from the
distribution archive, records tool versions into the run artifact (not
only the log), carries a written de-gating condition if it lands
non-blocking, writes artifacts outside the checkout, uploads failure
evidence (stimulus, both outputs, the diff), and triggers on push — "a
lane that runs on a schedule produces failures attributable to no commit."
**Incident.** The source's R-CI-4 (de-gating) was written at landing and
discharged much later — the written condition is what kept a non-blocking
lane from becoming decoration.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0003 (decisions 6–7).

`J-orchestrator-0136`, `J-orchestrator-0127`; [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0062`.

### L-D07 — Vendored third-party source is inviolate
**Rule.** Vendored third-party source is never edited in place
(configuration is a parameter, not a patch — a modified file bearing an
upstream SHA is a false provenance record), pin bumps land as their own
commit, and adding a reference tool does not enlarge what any existing
requirement means.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10 (licensing); docs/playbooks/ci-evidence.md
(planned).
**Provenance.** [ADR-0015-src] (D2, D3).

### L-D08 — A seal is a file, not a sentence, and its check is advisory
**Rule.** A commit may not introduce a withheld-result claim unless it
stages the artifact holding the withheld result — and the mechanical aid
stays an advisory warning, because distinguishing a claim from a quotation
is not a lexical test and "a gate that cannot tell a confession from a
crime must not be a gate".
**Incident.** A packet asserted a sealed sweep twice; it was never
committed, so the commissioned cross-check did not happen and could not be
manufactured after the fact. The proposed blocking check would have
refused the very commit carrying the verdict that discovered the defect,
at ~1-in-12 precision.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10 (R-SEAL-1) and §3 (withheld results);
ADR-0004.
**Provenance.** [ADR-0016-src] §2.5, §3, §5, §6.3; [WO-0049] §4; [J-dv]
`J-dv_lead-0062`, `-0063`.

### L-D09 — Evidence cites what a checkout can verify
**Rule.** Evidence cites (a) commands runnable from a repo checkout or
(b) externally verifiable references (run ID + conclusion), and any
mention of an ephemeral artifact says so explicitly.
**Incident.** Journal Evidence cited scratch artifacts unreachable from the
repo (audit finding F5); the auditor later noted "F5's standing rule is
nowhere an agent must read", and the rule was promoted into the protocol's
mandatory-reading path.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §4.1 (Evidence).
**Provenance.** [ADR-0003-src] (F5, Corrections); [J-aud]
`J-auditor-0003`.

### L-D10 — A sign-off cites a run, and a check that stood down said nothing
**Rule.** A sign-off cites a run, not a script — and SKIPPED /
OBLIGATION-OPEN outcomes never count as coverage; the harness refuses to
print OK over a stood-down check.
**Incident.** An external anchor stayed open across twelve fetch attempts;
when evidence finally arrived it convicted the claim before confirming the
repair — "zero fabrications". The check harness's own contract enforces
the second half.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/ci-evidence.md (planned); PROTOCOL §10
(no-verdict class).
**Provenance.** [rfc-anchor]; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0092`; [dv_checks]
(header and `run_and_label()`).

### L-D11 — Self-tests first: an instrument must prove it can still fail
**Rule.** Every instrument that judges a committed artifact proves it can
still fail before it is allowed to say anything passed — "a rule whose
teeth are never exercised can be blunted by a well-meaning simplification
without anything going red."
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/ci-evidence.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [dv_checks] (header); [WO-0028]/[WO-0034] arcs via [J-dv].

### L-D12 — A report is not a check
**Rule.** A count that would go stale is a report contributing nothing to
the pass/fail status — never a check that "fails for being correct".
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/ci-evidence.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0042`; [dv_checks] (bench-inventory
block).

### L-D13 — Prose gates are narrow, and the narrowing carries its argument
**Rule.** Prose may not gate a build as keywords — but a verbatim
40+-character sentence scoped to a named section may, and a standing rule
narrowed this way carries its argument in the file; gate the absence of
the wrong value too, so the correction cannot quietly become
unfalsifiable.
**Incident.** An anchor reclassification: dv gated the absence of the
superseded constant alongside the presence of the correct sentence, "so my
correction doesn't quietly become unfalsifiable".
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/ci-evidence.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0019`.

### L-D14 — A new source directory needs a build disposition
**Rule.** A new directory holding compilable sources gets an explicit build
disposition in the same change — an undisposed directory is one whose
sources would be silently uncompiled.
**Incident.** A near-miss in family D, then a live catch of an in-flight
undisposed test directory; the check lane made both visible.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/ci-evidence.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [precompile] (lane 3a); [WO-0047] §6.10; [J-dv]
`J-dv_lead-0054`.

### L-D15 — Derived views verify their inputs are committed
**Rule.** Before rebuilding any derived, outward-facing view of the record,
verify the inputs match HEAD for every active agent — a builder that reads
the working tree will bake uncommitted state into published pages.
**Now lives in.** Narrative only.
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0127` ("the J-orchestrator-0125
class"), `J-orchestrator-0130`.

### L-D16 — An enumerated-identity check that validates one value
**Rule.** A self-identification check that validates only one value of an
enumerated identity gives false assurance for every other value: the
uncovered values produce neither a pass nor a failure, and the run's
aggregate green is read as coverage. Scope the check to every value of the
enumeration, or state its coverage where its result is read. Neighbouring
disciplines do not substitute for this one — a proving scenario can exist
and pass *because* the check declined to speak (L-A11), and an instrument
can demonstrate it is able to fail on the one value it covers (L-D11),
while the uncovered values stay silently unverified. Where the check's own
OK line sits inside the guarded branch, nothing is printed at all, so the
stood-down-check remedy (L-D10) has nothing to bite on.
**Incident.** A repository template recorded its own identity in a state
file: a role field drawn from a fixed enumeration of four values, and a
field naming the repository's own canonical URL. A copy inherited both
fields from its parent and was required to rewrite them as its first act;
a copy that had not done so was, by definition, not yet founded. A
continuous-integration check existed for exactly this and compared the
recorded URL against the actual remote — but it had been written when only
one of the four role values was in play, and fired only when the role field
held that value. A copy was later taken while the role field held one of
the unchecked values. Its recorded URL named its parent; its actual remote
named itself. The check ran and passed, and the whole history was green on
a repository whose own state file asserted it was a different repository.
The condition was found only because a human-readable bootstrap document
told the reader to compare the two fields by hand.
**Now lives in.** Narrative only — the defective check belongs to an
upstream repository, so an amendment obligation opened at this fence could
not be discharged here (screening report, `LC-01`, screen 4).

## E. Communication & relay discipline

### L-E01 — The verbatim relay classes
**Rule.** Auditor CRITICALs, bug packets, verification verdict text to the
sponsor, campaign run output, and the blinding bar list itself are relayed
verbatim — fidelity is load-bearing, and the auditor spot-checks relay
fidelity on the protected classes.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §3 (relay rule), §8 (E4).
**Provenance.** [PROTOCOL-v1] §3/§8; [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0115`,
`J-orchestrator-0110`; [WO-0039] §5.4; [BUG-0001].

### L-E02 — Transcription is clerical, and the transcriber states the relay limit
**Rule.** A transcription's authority lives in the signer's or decider's
own committed record; the transcriber states the relay limit explicitly
("I did not observe the decision UI; if either was altered in relay, this
record inherits the alteration").
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §3 (auditor exception), §7 (signature
transcription).
**Provenance.** [ADR-0015-src] ("E3 grants — transcribed").

### L-E03 — Signatures say what they sign, and their effect is visible
**Rule.** A gate signature's journal entry literally states "I sign gate X
item Y"; historical signatures are re-affirmed in the required form, never
retrofitted into an append-only journal; and a signature's legal effect is
stated in the packet it acts on, not implied.
**Incident.** No bootstrap signature satisfied the authority formula; items
were re-signed in the required form across two entries. A later verdict
class was explicitly marked as the seal of the sponsor's delegated
decision so its effect was readable in place.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §7.
**Provenance.** [ADR-0003-src] (F4); [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0009`,
`-0012`, `-0039`.

### L-E04 — Freeze atomically, and derive only from committed signed text
**Rule.** A freeze signature covers all its documents at one SHA (split
freezes invite drift), and an agent working beside another's uncommitted
edits derives only from committed signed text.
**Incident.** Mid-flight evidence supersession made flipping a freeze on
the old run "evidence laundering"; the atomic-signature form and the
isolation discipline are "the behaviour that makes parallel lanes safe to
run again".
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md and
docs/playbooks/packet-splitting.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0039`.

### L-E05 — Findings route as questions
**Rule.** A finding routes to its owner as a question with the recommended
repair as input, not as a prescription.
**Now lives in.** docs/playbooks/review.md (planned).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0067`.

### L-E06 — Disclosure after the fact is not authorization before it
**Rule.** Honest disclosure after the fact is not authorization before it;
deliberate tests of protections are pre-declared to the sponsor or covered
by an ADR'd procedure — and the lesson must not be read as "disclose
less".
**Incident.** The sole committer self-authorized a force-push exception on
the very branch the rule protects, then disclosed it honestly; the auditor
ruled the disclosure did not cure the self-authorization (finding N6).
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §8.
**Provenance.** [AUD-0002]; [J-aud] `J-auditor-0003`; adopted [J-orch]
`J-orchestrator-0012`.

### L-E07 — The auditor labels a request a request
**Rule.** An auditor labels a REQUEST as a request rather than a block
("the distinction matters more than getting my way on it"), and does not
block a gate on a finding about its own predecessor's tally.
**Now lives in.** Narrative only (auditor conduct; charter-adjacent).
**Provenance.** [J-aud] `J-auditor-0003`.

### L-E08 — Spawn discipline: check-ins, short-ids, and signatures
**Rule.** Fallback check-ins are armed at spawn time, not after silence;
spawn short-ids are minted at spawn time; and nothing is signed until its
evidence lands.
**Incident.** Interrupting the orchestrator silently killed an in-flight
lead spawn with no armed check-in; two bootstrap findings (a short-id
predating its packet, a signature predating its evidence) fixed the other
two habits.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §3 (spawn discipline), §4.1 (spawn short-id).
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0024` → `-0028`; [ADR-0003-src]
(F8, F12).

### L-E09 — An audit pins its baseline SHA at spawn
**Rule.** An audit's baseline SHA is pinned in the spawn prompt or packet,
and findings are adjudicated against the pin, not a moving tree.
**Incident.** The first audit's baseline moved mid-audit — a shared-tree
hazard named in the findings.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §3 (spawn discipline).
**Provenance.** [ADR-0003-src] (F13–F15).

### L-E10 — Open questions are artifacts on the board
**Rule.** Open questions land on the program board, not only in journals or
inside an ADR's narrative.
**Incident.** Charter-writer open questions were dispositioned inside an
ADR's narrative and existed as no artifact anyone tracked.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §9 (BOARD.md).
**Provenance.** [ADR-0003-src] (F11).

## F. Org-topology lessons

### L-F01 — The protocol froze while the rules kept accreting elsewhere
**Rule.** A constitution that is never amended does not stop rules from
accreting — it only moves them into ADRs, packet templates, tool headers,
and journals, where new agents do not have to read them.
**Incident.** The source's protocol was never amended after G0; every rule
in this file accreted outside it. The source made part of this deliberate
(namespaced ADR-minted rule IDs with enforcement class stated in the same
sentence), but the net effect was a constitution that described a younger
org than the one operating.
**How this shell fixes it.** PROTOCOL v2 *is* the amendment the source
never performed: the accreted rules are folded back into the constitution
(R10 and §4.3 volumes; R-SEAL-1 in §10 with §3's signpost; the freeze-first
mutation model in §10; spawn discipline and audit pinning in §3; the
Evidence rule in §4.1; the ordering rule in §9; the provenance classes in
§10), and §11 makes future accretion cheaper to fold in than to scatter —
every proposed rule is corpus-backtested and lands by ADR, with namespaced
IDs still available for review-enforced rules so the R-namespace stays
honest.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §11 (the amendment procedure itself).
**Provenance.** Harvest observation over the whole record; [PROTOCOL-v1]
(unchanged from G0); [ADR-0016-src] §5 (the deliberate half).

### L-F02 — The packet template is the real rule-propagation vehicle
**Rule.** Standing rules reach the agents who must follow them through the
next packet's numbered obligations, not through journals — a worker reads
its work order, not the org's history.
**Incident.** The source's later bench packets accumulated "the regime
facts already paid for" as a numbered section workers actually read; this
is the org's answer to "a fix recorded only in a journal does not protect
the file it was made in."
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §3 (templates); the four planned playbooks are
this lesson institutionalized.
**Provenance.** [WO-0047] §6; [WO-0040]/[WO-0043] §6 lineage.

### L-F03 — Charters claim nothing the scripts don't check
**Rule.** No org document claims a control that nothing performs without
naming the compensating control — "the honesty property the org's
credibility rests on."
**Now lives in.** ADR-0002; PROTOCOL §5 (R1 honesty note), §6 ("honestly
documented as such").
**Provenance.** [ADR-0002-src] (Consequences).

### L-F04 — Blinding runs on disclosure, not enforcement
**Rule.** The blinding regime's control is stated bars plus journaled
disclosure — "there is no script standing behind it… both of us are
accountable in a journal" — and it measurably held: four campaigns, every
breach self-reported by the blinded party.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0007 (decision 1).
**Provenance.** [WO-0039] §0; [WO-0041] §1; [WO-0045] §1; [WO-0050] §1.

### L-F05 — The reviewer's own artifacts are a side channel, structurally
**Rule.** Once a reviewer proves its checks by quoting protected material,
its verdicts, scratch files, and commit subjects all become sealed surface
— this is structural to any reviewer-with-a-journal topology, since
proving the check requires quoting what is protected.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10 (information hygiene); ADR-0007
(decision 6).
**Provenance.** [J-dv] `J-dv_lead-0040`; harvest §F.

### L-F06 — A floor given to a no-stake party outperforms a ceiling
**Rule.** A no-stake third party given a floor (disclose everything; the
void call is not yours) rather than a ceiling (an enumerated bar list)
outperformed the rule-writer three rounds running — design conduct rules
as floors for the parties with nothing to gain.
**Incident.** The auditor's voluntary refusals and unprompted disclosures
caught what the enumerated bars missed; dv named it honestly: "not 'good
auditor' but 'my rules keep arriving one commit late'."
**Now lives in.** ADR-0007 (decision 4, Consequences).
**Provenance.** [J-aud] `J-auditor-0004`, `-0005`; [J-dv]
`J-dv_lead-0045`/`-0046`.

### L-F07 — The blob-gate incident is the shape of a scaling failure
**Rule.** An org's core prose record will eventually outgrow a gate
designed for something else; the correct response is a bounded override
with a counted end condition plus a routed design decision — never a
silent threshold bump.
**Incident.** The journal that outgrew the data-blob gate produced exactly
this response: a counted interim, an ADR to the architect, and a rotation
design whose arithmetic ("the override expires by arithmetic after about
six more entries") forced the fix to land.
**Now lives in.** ADR-0005; PROTOCOL §5 (override sentence), §4.3.
**Provenance.** [J-orch] `J-orchestrator-0137`; [ADR-0017-src] (landed past
the seeding pin; cited at its landing commit).

### L-F08 — Practice diverged from the written mutation model, and the text never caught up
**Rule.** When operating practice supersedes a constitution's written
model, the text is amended or the org is governed by a document that
describes something it no longer does.
**Incident.** The source's §10 described transient uncommitted-tree
mutations applied by the orchestrator; practice evolved to throwaway
never-merged marked branches, auditor-authored, CI-executed,
dv-adjudicated, with frozen sealed predictions — and §10 was never
updated. The source's own harvest flags this as tolerated drift.
**How this shell fixes it.** PROTOCOL v2 §10 codifies the practiced model
as the written one — freeze-first with a SEALED companion, the three-way
prediction classes, the no-stake blinded seeder under an allowlist,
diffs-before-runs on never-merged marked branches, verbatim adjudication,
the owed silently-always-pass class, equivalence as a proof obligation,
and information hygiene — and ADR-0006 records the practiced model's full
rationale so the next divergence has to argue against the record rather
than merely outgrow it. L-F01's amendment machinery (§11) is the standing
answer for the round after that.
**Now lives in.** PROTOCOL §10; ADR-0006.
**Provenance.** [PROTOCOL-v1] §10 (the superseded model); [WO-0039] …
[WO-0050] (the practiced one); harvest §F.

## Harvest flags — dispositions

The harvest flagged five referenced-but-not-found items; their dispositions
here, for completeness (narrative only):

- **Spec countersignature discipline** is original source design
  (PROTOCOL §7 lineage), not an accretion; its accretions — atomic
  multi-spec freeze at one SHA, the signature-authority formula, and
  re-countersignature-owed — are covered at L-E03/L-E04.
- **"Golden models need external anchors"** is original design (now
  PROTOCOL §10); the accretion was its enforcement — no sign-off may rest
  on an unanchored model, plus the tripwire idiom at L-B09.
- **Escalation classes** are original design (PROTOCOL §8); the accretions
  are L-E06 (disclosure ≠ authorization) and L-E02 (transcription form).
- **The promotion-block pattern** existed in the source only as three
  journal entries plus workflow code; this shell names it as a pattern in
  ADR-0003 (decision 3) — L-D02.
- **The journal-rotation ADR** was dispatched but unwritten at the seeding
  pin ("the one live rule-gap in the record"); it landed past the pin as
  the source's ADR-0017 and is adopted natively here as PROTOCOL §4.3/R10
  + ADR-0005.

No sealed companion file was opened in preparing this record; sealed-file
content is reported only as quoted in the non-sealed packets and verdicts.
